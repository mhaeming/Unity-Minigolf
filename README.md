# Unity Minigolf 2.0

Unity Minigolf 2.0 is the second iteration of an endless runner that combines a game of adventure golf with an experimental paradigm. It was was created using the Unity game engine.

## Background
The video presentation of the first iteration of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qfP62a3Mxs06t6jC-raJkaodDHNCQeNt/view).


For further explanations about the project and what changes were made, reference the concept paper ['AdvancedUnity_Concept.pdf'](AdvancedUnity_Concept.pdf), the [Presentational Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vX-jK4KGKzsWBsVaTGB5eI8TFgeEVpjE/view) or its corresponding Script ['AdvancedUnity_Script.pdf'](AdvancedUnity_Script.pdf).

## Experimental paradigm
With this game, we aim to present an experimental paradigm for investigating the influence of free character choice on individual gaming experience and performance. This paradigm was inspired by [a study from 1976](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-28515-001), in which Langer and Rodin investigated the effects of increased responsibility over choices in an elderly peopleâ€™s home. The elderly people who were allowed to make their own choices lead a happier and more active life.. Players are divided into an experimental group that is given the choice of which character to play with and a control group that is not given a choice. In order to measure their gaming performance, different parameters like levels achieved and number of failures are collected. Participants of both groups are asked to fill out a small survey to assess their gaming experience in the end. Survey Questions can be found in the file  ['AdvancedUnity_Questions.pdf'](AdvancedUnity_Questions.pdf).

## Installation
